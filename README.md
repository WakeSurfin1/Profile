# Hello World, I'm John - aka - Wakesurfin1
I'm a data engineer, teacher, coach, boater, and lover of the outdoors.

\* Currenlty I'm trying to learn all things related to cloud data platforms and data analytics...it never ends.

\* As you know generative AI and prompt engineering is about to change everything. So, let's plan to keep up.

\* Fun fact: I was a competive swimmer up through 12 grade but I gave it up for the college life.
